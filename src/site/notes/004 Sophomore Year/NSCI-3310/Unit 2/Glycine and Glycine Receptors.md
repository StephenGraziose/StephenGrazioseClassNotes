### Glycine
- Primarily generated in the brainstem and the spinal cord

### Shunting Inhibition
- <u>Shunting of current out of cell via open Cl- channels</u>
	- Inhibitory synapse ahead of a traveling signal causes inhibition through Cl- release
	- Prevents the flow of inward currents to the axon hillock
		- **Kinda like a shoulder check to a hockey player**
		- Reduces strength/size of EPSPs

Frankly, Glycine is not that referenced or important in the context of this course.
