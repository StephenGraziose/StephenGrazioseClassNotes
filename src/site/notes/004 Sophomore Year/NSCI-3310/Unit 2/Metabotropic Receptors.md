**Metabotropic receptors** are one of two [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Chemical Synapses\|chemical synaptic receptor types]] on the postsynaptic cell. They are also referred to as **G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)**.

### GPCRs 
- 7 transmembrane segment (7TMs) receptors
	- Ligand binds to the receptor
		- Triggers **G-protein** to trigger the alpha-subunit to become phosphorylated from GTP
			- Recruits beta-gamma dimer 
				- Both units do their things and eventually phosphorylate adenylyl cyclase
					- **Adenylyl cyclase** breaks down **ATP** into **cAMP** (second-messenger that further internally relays message)
						- cAMP binds to second-messenger-gated channels

>Once again, remember that GPCRs are not ion channels. They are connected to [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Ion Channels#Second Messenger-Gated Ion Channels\|second messenger-gated ion channels]], though, which are gated by phosphorylation that occurs with second messengers such as cAMP.

### The G Protein and G Protein Activation
- The G protein has 3 protein subunits
	- **Alpha, beta, and gamma subunits**
	- The G protein is membrane-associated
		- Lipid-bound
	- GDP is bound to the alpha subunit when the alpha subunit is inactive
- Ligand binding to the GPCR
	- G protein associates with the receptor in general
	- Once the ligand binds to the GPCR, the G protein is activated
		- GTP binds to the alpha subunit and kicks off GDP
		- The **alpha-GTP subunit** then dissociates from the beta and gamma subunits, and the **beta-gamma dimer** forms as a result
			- Both the alpha-GTP subunit and the beta-gamma dimer can each signal other things
				- Meaning, they can trigger other reactions within the cell
				- The alpha-GTP subunit activates [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 3/Second Messenger Systems\|Second Messenger Systems]]
				- The beta-gamma dimer **can act directly on ion channels**

### Metabotropic Receptors
- Activation can lead to the **opening OR closing of channels**
	- Actions can occur distant from receptors
		- Diffusable messengers
	- Amplification of signals
		- One GPCR can signal to multiple G proteins in a singular neuron
	- Prolonged response: Opening or closing of channels
		- This causes changes in membrane potential occurring
	- Changes in membrane resistance
		- Basically just changes in the *membrane's responsivity* based on Ohm's Law (V = IR)
- Metabotropic receptors cause slow [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 3/Synaptic Modulation\|synaptic modulation.]]
