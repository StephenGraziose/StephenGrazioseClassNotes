Remember that all of this is related to [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Ion Equilibrium Potentials\|Ion Equilibrium Potentials]]!

- **Revisting Reversal Potentials** [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/GABA and GABA Receptors\|(Cl- ionotropics)]]:
	- *Reversal Potential to GABAa: -70mV*
	- When Vm is > -70mV:
		- More positive
		- Cl- flows into the cell due to being attracted to positive electrostatic forces
		- <u>Inward current</u>
	    - When Vm is < -70mV
		- Less positive
		- Cl- flows out of the cell due to being repulsed by negative electrostatic forces
		- <u>Outward current</u>
- **Revisiting Reversal Potentials** [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors\|(Excitatory ionotropics)]]:
	- *Reversal Potential for iGluR: 0mV*
	- When Vm > 0mV:
		- More positive
		- K+ dominates over Na+ due to higher positive charges forcing K+ out more and repulsing Na+ entry more
		- <u>Outward current</u>
	- When Vm < 0mV:
		- Less positive
		- Na+ dominates over K+ due to higher negative charges pulling Na+ into the cell more and withdrawing K+ into the cell
		- <u>Inward current</u>

>These numbers sound really complicated to memorize, so just think like an ion!
>
>**For Na+**: There's a lot of Na+ outside of the cell, so a more positive cell membrane would repulse them from entering and a more negative membrane potential would attract them inwards!
>
>**For K+**: There's a ton of K+ inside of the cell, so a more positive cell membrane would repulse them outwards more from the cell and a more negative potential would make them want to stay inside more! 
>
>**For Cl-**: Cl- wants to enter the cell, so more positive currents would draw them in and more negative currents would draw them out.
