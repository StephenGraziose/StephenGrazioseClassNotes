Once released from the presynaptic terminal, neurotransmitters will enter the synaptic cleft and then travel towards the postsynaptic cell.

These neurotransmitters will act as ligands to these receptors and bind to them, causing them to undergo a conformational change and to create a change in the postsynaptic cell.

There are two major types of chemical synapse receptors in the nervous system: [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Ionotropic Receptors\|Ionotropic Receptors]] and [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Metabotropic Receptors\|Metabotropic Receptors]]
