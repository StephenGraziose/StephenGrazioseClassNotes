For the CNS, the major [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 3/Neurotransmitters\|neurotransmitter]] involved in IPSP generation is **GABA**

GABA is selective only towards **Cl- ions.**

- **IPSP Reversal**
	- Inhibitory Interneurons are involved within this process
		- Neurotransmitters involved
			- GABA
				- Generated in the brain
			- Glycine
				- Generated in the brain stem and the spinal cord
	- Receptors involved
		- GABA --> GABAa receptors
		- Glycine --> Glycine receptors
	- Outward current at rest
		- **Vreversal = -70mV**
		- Cl- current involved with this
			- Remember that Cl- enters the cell, meaning that negative charge is entering the cell

### GABA
- Inhibitory amino acid
- Full name is **$\gamma$-aminobutyric acid**
- Synthesis occurs in the terminal
	- Precursor is **glutamate**
	- Synthesis is catalyzed by **glutamic acid decarboxylase and pyridoxal phosphate**
	- Loaded into vesicles by **vesicular GABA transporters (vGAT)**
- Release
	- Postsynaptic receptors
		- **Ionotropic (GABAa)**
			- <u>Cl- channel</u>
		- **Metabotropic (GABAb)**
			- <u>Indirect gating of K+ and Ca2+</u>
- Reuptake
	- GABA transporters are present on astrocytes and neurons
		- Perform recycling breakdown
	- GABA transporters are present

### GABA Receptors

#### Ionotropic GABA Receptors
-  Ionotropic GABA receptors are called **GABAa Receptors**
	- Heteropentamer
		- 5 subunit types
			- $\alpha$ subunits
			- $\beta$ subunits
			- $\gamma$ subunits
			- $\delta$ subunits
			- $\rho$ subunits
	- Modularity sites
		- GABA (ligand)
		- Barbiturate (agonist)
		- Benzodiazepines (agonist)
		- Steroids (agonist)
		- Picrotoxin (antagonist)
		- Ethanol (agonist)
	- Outward current --> Composed of outward single channel currents
- GABAa receptors, when activated, **open Cl- channels**, causing hyperpolarization (Cl- flows into the cell)

#### Metabotropic GABA Receptors
- Metabotropic GABA receptors are called **GABAb Receptors**
	- GABAb receptors, when activated, trigger second messenger cascades that end up **opening second messenger-gated K+ channels**, causing hyperpolarization (K+ flows out of the cell)

### Shunting Inhibition
- Shunting of current out of cell via open Cl- channels
	- Inhibitory synapse ahead of a traveling signal causes inhibition through Cl- release
	- Prevents the flow of inward currents to the axon hillock
		- Kinda like a shoulder check to a hockey player
		- <u>Reduces strength/size of EPSPs</u>

>[!info] Summary:
>
>GABAa: **Ionotropic**, *inhibitory* (cause an outward current), and involves Cl- influx. <u>This is a ligand-gated Cl- channel.</u>
>
>GABAb: **Metabotropic**, triggers a second messenger cascade that ends up <u>opening second messenger-gated K+ channels, causing K+ efflux</u> (*inhibitory*).
