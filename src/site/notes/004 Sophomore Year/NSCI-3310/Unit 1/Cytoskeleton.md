The **Cytoskeleton** is a dynamic network of cellular proteins that maintain the structrure of cell and also support transport of various different molecules throughout the cell, such as vesicles. 

The cytoskeleton is comprised of 3 specific [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Proteins\|fibrillar proteins]]:
- **Microtubules**
	- Comprised of **tubulin**
	- Create a nice straight pathway to formulate a highway for proteins to travel across
	- Dynamic instability
- **Neurofilaments**
	- Comprised of **cytokeratins**
	- Intermediate in diameter
- **Microfilaments**
	- Comprised of **actin**
	- Scattered throughout
	- Dynamic instability
