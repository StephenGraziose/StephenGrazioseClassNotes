**Glia** are a major category of cells in the Nervous System, and are primarily responsible for *supporting and nourishing* the [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Neurons\|Neurons]]. There are multiple types of glial cells within both the PNS and the CNS of the nervous system:

### CNS Glia

#### Oligodendrocytes
- CNS
	- Form myelin sheaths around CNS axons in white matter areas
		- Remember that **white matter is axons**
		- Surround neuronal cell bodies in gray matter
			- Remember that **gray matter is cell bodies**
- Functions:
	- <u>Myelination</u>
		- Small arms of the cell encase and surround portions of the axon with myelin
		- Metabolic support/extracellular regulation
- Structure:
	- Processes (mini arms) of the individual oligodendrocytes form myelin sheaths around all but the smallest axons
		- **Nodes of Ranvier** between myelin segments similar to that of the PNS
			- These are spaces in between the myelinated segments
				- Cause [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Action Potential Conduction\|saltatory conduction]]
	- **Perineuronal**: 
		- Oligodendrocytes with no processes/myelin 
			- Up in the air with what they do

#### Astrocytes
- CNS
	- Most abundant cell type
		- Found throughout the CNS
			- Neuronal cell bodies
			- Dendrites
			- Axons
			- Terminals
		- Form a complete lining around:
			- <u>Every single external surfaces of the CNS</u>
				- Ex: If nerve tissue covers the meninges or a blood vessel, astrocytes will be there to line that nerve tissue
			- <u>CNS blood vessels</u>
		- Adult terminal astrocytes stay in their location, but can have a plastic structure
			- Their processes can grow and change locations, changing which neurons they communicate with
		- **Fibrous astrocytes** are found in <u>white matter</u>
			- Fibrous in nature and also hang out by fibers
			- Helps out axons
				- Remember, white matter is axons
		- **Protoplasmic astrocytes** are found in <u>gray matter</u>
			- Can do things like feed neurons or regulate neurotransmitters, etc.
				- Remember that cell bodies are gray matter
			- Have more intermediate filaments
				- Super thick non dynamic cytoskeletal proteins
- Functions:
	- Maintenance of **extracellular ionic environment**
		- Ions are moving into the neurons to create messages
			- This environment is regulated and supported by the astrocytes
		- Secretion of **growth factors**
		- **Structural/metabolic support**
			- Feeding neurons glucose and stuff
		- **Take up/release neurotransmitters**
			- Either removes excess neurotransmitters or dumps out more
			- Can prevent excitotoxicity
				- Removes [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors\|glutamate]] when it is in excess
			- This is referred to as **neuromodulation**
				- Using multiple different types of neurotransmitters to regulate communication and other forms of messaging
				- Sometimes astrocytes dump neurotransmitters into blood vessels to spread neuroinflammatory signals and other messages
- Structure:
	- Contain processes (little arms) just like oligodendrocytes
		- Project and touch neuron surfaces
		- Stellate, highly branched cells
		- End-feet join together to line interfaces between CNS and other tissues

#### Microglia
- CNS
	- Found in gray and white matter
		- Hang out in the areas where they are born
- Functions:
	- **Scavenging/phagocytosis of debris** following cell injury/death
		- Secretion of **cytokines**
			- Done a lot by reactive microglia
		- **Maintain homeostasis**
	- Structure
		- **Reactive microglia** migrate to damaged areas and proliferate
			- Large, amoeboid shape
		- **Ramified microglia** survey blood/neurons/glia with very long processes
		- Very tiny by comparison to other cells
		- These two above structures appear to be like different forms of the microglia
			- Normally in the ramified state, but convert to the reactive state when issues are detected
				- Chemicals that bind to receptors on their processes are what they are looking for/are what they detect

#### Radial Glia
- CNS
	- In the developing CNS
		- Found in the adult retina
		- Cerebellum
- Functions:
	- **Neuronal scaffolding**
		- Help neurons climb and grow to where they need to be
	- Progenitors for neurons
	- Adult neuronal communication/plasticity
- Structure:
	- Long bipolar shape

#### Ependymal Cells
- CNS
	- Line the spinal cord
		- Line the brain ventricular system
- Functions:
	- Production/circulation of CSF
		- Formation of the blood-CSF barrier
- Structure:
	- Cuboidal with cilia

### PNS Glia

#### Schwann Cells
- PNS
	- Forms myelin sheaths around myelinated axons
		- Ensheath unmyelinated axons
- Functions:
	- **Myelination**
		- Basically wrap their entire bodies around a segment of the axon
	- **Biochemical/structural support** of myelinated/unmyelinated axons
		- Some axons do not need to be myelinated, do not have a purpose for high-speed communication
			- Schwann cells can help stabilize and assist these unmyelinated cells
- Structure:
	- Tight spiral wrapping of fused plasma membrane to form a sheath around larger or more intermediate-diameter axons
		- Condoms for axons
			- Invaginations for small axons
				- Done by **non-myelinating Schwann cells**

#### Satellite Cells
- PNS
	- Surrounding neuron cell bodies in the PNS ganglia
		- Reminder that ganglia are where PNS cell bodies are found
			- Named because they're like satellites to PNS neurons
- Functions:
	- Regulate the external chemical environment
- Structure:
	- Small cells connected by gap junctions
		- Gap junctions allow for ions and small communicating molecules to directly pass between cells
		- NOT star shaped
- PNS partial counterpart of astrocytes

#### Macrophages
-  Macrophages are not glial cells, but they are the PNS counterpart of microglia in the CNS
	- Peripheral immune system
