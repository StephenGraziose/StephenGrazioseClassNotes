**Exocytosis** is a cellular process of expelling contents of the cell into the extracellular environment.

**Endocytosis** is a cellular process of uptaking contents from the extracellular environment into the cell.

## Exocytosis
- Vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane
	- This is a format of active transport too
	- Secretion of proteins in vesicle lumen into the extracellular space
		- Stuff goes from inside of the cell to outside of the cell
	- This is a form of chemical transmission
	- **Insertion of vesicle membrane proteins into the plasma membrane**
		- Ex: Receptors
		- This can occur within the dendritic spines or the axon terminal
	- This is the basis of [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 3/Neurotransmitters\|neurotransmitter]] activity
    - **Golgi apparatus** generates the vesicles required for this process to occur
- Here's a link to [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Neurotransmitter Release\|Neurotransmitter Release]]

## Endocytosis
- Vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane too
	- Also another format of active transport
	- Cellular uptake of molecules through vesicles
	- Occurs through rather specific procedures
- Another essential aspect of cellular transport for proteins and other molecules
