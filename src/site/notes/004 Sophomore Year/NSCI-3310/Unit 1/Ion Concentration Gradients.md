> Membrane potential is established by differing concentrations of ions and their  currents inside and outside of the cell!

- Ion concentration gradients
	- [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Resting Membrane Potential\|Membrane potential]]Â due to different intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations
    - There are different concentrations of ions in cells:
	- **$Na^+$**
		- **Higher concentration outside the cell**
		- *Inward flow*
	- **Cl-**
		- **Higher concentration outside the cell**
		- *Inward flow*
	- **K+**
		- **Higher concentration inside of the cell**
		- **Outward flow**
	- **Ca2+**
		- **MUCH higher concentration outside the cell**
		- Very low inside of the cell
		- **Inward flow**
- Neurons are salty bananas!
	- Ions do not always follow their concentration gradients due to the fact that they face electrostatic forces too
	- $[K+]_{inside}$ > $[K+]_{outside}$ :
		- $K^+$ pumped into neurons
		- Extracellular K+ uptake by astrocytes
	- $[Na^+]_{inside}$ < $[Na^+]_{outside}$ :
		- $Na^+$ pumped out of neurons
	- Low $[\ce{Cl-]}$ inside:
		- $Cl^-$ pumped out of neurons
	- Low $\ce{[Ca^2+]}$ inside:
		- $\ce{Ca^2+}$ stored in the smooth ER

>**Na+:** Higher concentration outside of the cell. Positive. Wants to flow into the cell. Inward current.
>
>**K+:** Higher concentration inside of the cell. Positive. Wants to flow out of the cell. Outward current.
>
>**Cl-:** Higher concentration outside of the cell. Negative. Wants to flow into the cell. Outward current.
>
>**Ca2+:** Higher concentration outside of the cell. Positive. Cannot usually flow into the cell due to low permeability. Inward current.
