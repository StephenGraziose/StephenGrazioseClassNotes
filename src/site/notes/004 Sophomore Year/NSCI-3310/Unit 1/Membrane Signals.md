There are a few types of membrane signals that occur as a result of the change in membrane potential:

### Resting potential

- The cell membrane at rest
	- Cells are normally just polarized at rest
	- The [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Ion Channels#Leak Channels\|leak channels]] do not form this, they instead just maintain it
	- This is actually formed by chemical and electrostatic forces
	- [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Resting Membrane Potential\|Resting Membrane Potential]] is **~-65mV**

### Changes in Current Direction

**Hyperpolarization**
- *Outward* current
- An increase in *negative* *charge* (makes the intracellular and extracellular space even more polarized)
	- Moving <u>positive charges outside</u> of the cell
	- Moving <u>negative charges into</u> the cell

**Depolarization**
- *Inward* current
- An increase in *positive* *charge* (makes the intracellular and extracellular space less polarized)
	- Moving <u>positive charges into </u>the cell
	- Moving <u>negative charges outside</u> of the cell

### Graded vs Action Potentials

**Graded Potentials (Passive Potentials)**
- Proportionate to input
	- However many <u>ions go in or out affects the strength and size of the graded potential</u>
- *Passively* propagated
- Caused by ions channels and general ion transport
- Graded means that the size can change and vary based on how many ions are making the movement
- Essentially is like ripples in a pond

[[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Neurons - Action Potential\|Action Potentials]]
- All or nothing
	- Summation of graded potentials at the [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Neurons#Axon Hillock\|axon hillock]]
		- Suprathreshold
	- Same size, same shape
- *Actively* propagated

All of these changes are as a result of [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Ion Concentration Gradients\|ion concentration gradients.]]
