All the different ions that flow into and out of the cell (Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+) have a certain voltage at which their **chemical gradient** and **electrical gradient** cancel each other out, causing no net flow into or out of the cell. This is known as the **Equilibrium Potential** of an ion.

Each ion has a different equilibrium potential, which is caused by their charge and their concentration inside of and outside of the cell:

| Ion  | Equilibrium Potential |
|:----:| --------------------- |
| Na+  | +60mV to +65mV        |
|  K+  | -80mV to -90mV        |
| Cl-  | -65mV to -70mV        |
| Ca2+ | +250mV                |

>**For Na+:** It wants to flow in the cell, but if the cell was really positive, it would be electronically repulsed from entering.
>
>**For K+:** It wants to flow out of the cell, but if the cell was really negative, it would be electronically attracted to the cell and would not want to leave.

>**For Cl-:** It wants to flow into the cell, but if the cell was really negative, it would be electronically repulsed from the cell and would not want to enter.

>**For Ca2+:** It wants to flow into the cell, but if the cell was SUPER positive, it would be electronically repulsed from entering.
