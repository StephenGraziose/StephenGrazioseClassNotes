**Cajal's Neuron Doctrine** explains the flow of information within [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Neurons\|Neurons]].

- Neuron polarity
	- Directionality of information flow
		- Goes from dendrites to soma to axon hillock to axon to axon terminal
		- Pre-synaptic (upstream) vs post-synaptic (downstream) neurons
		- All relative to a given synapse
	- Dendrites
		- EPSPs and IPSPs
			- Passive signal conductance
			- This is basically graded potentials that occur because of synaptic potentials
	- Axon
		- Action potential
		- Active signal conductance
			- This is the action potential lol
	- Axon terminal
		- Synaptic transmission
			- From presynaptic neurons to postsynaptic neurons
- **Backpropagation**Â is an exception to this rule
	- Active signal conductance (action potential) goes backwards in the dendrites
		- Retrograde transmission occurs through dendritic transmitters
