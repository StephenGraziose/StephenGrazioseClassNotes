Neuroscientists use different techniques and technologies to record, read, and interpret various electrical currents occurring within neurons, as they explain the activity of a neuron.

These currents are observed within the different [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Voltage-Gated Channels\|voltage-gated ion channels]] within the cell membranes of these neurons

### Recording Single Channel Currents

- This is done using the **Patch Clamp Technique**
	- <u>Patch clamp checks the current of a single ion channel</u>
		- Super small section that is being clamped that it can be only one ion channel
	- Remember that when we inject current to measure voltage:
		- **Upward deflection means outward current**
		- **Downward deflection means inward current**

>The reason why inward is downwards and outward is upwards is because **the reading is the voltage of the outside of the cell**. When inward current occurs, the ECM becomes more negatively charged. When outward current occurs, the ECM becomes more positively charged.

- Single channel currents = Rectangular currents
	- On/Off = all or none
		- Channel is either open or closed
	- Different channels = Different conductance
		- Different conductance means different amplitude of waves
	- Current flow dependent on the time the channel is open, as well as the frequency of opening
- Voltage sensitivity
	- Depolarization sensitive
- Single current amplitude is a function of membrane voltage potential (Vm)
	- If the membrane was polarized a whole lot, the amplitude of a single current would be different
		- Due to the driving force of the ion being modified
		- For K+ channels, more depolarized cell membrane means stronger amplitude peaks due *to the K+ ions being further repelled out of the cell*
- <u>Increased channel opening probability with depolarization</u>

### Recording Whole Cell Currents

- Macroscopic currents
	- Summated single ion channel currents for the whole cell
- Current direction/amplitude is a function of the unitary currents that add up to form the whole cell current
- Instead of patch clamp, you check the current across the WHOLE CELL
	- Basically averages out to a smooth wave
- Be able to determine if currents are inwards or outwards, if it is Na+ or K+, and whole cell currents

### [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 1/Neurons - Action Potential\|Action Potential]] Currents

#### Sodium currents
- **Inward** currents
	- Na+ enters the cell
		- Graph reads downwards
	- Single channel currents summate
	- Causes depolarization (AP rising phase)
		- Membrane is becoming more positive

#### Potassium currents
- **Outward** currents
	- K+ exits the cell
		- Graph reads upwards
	- Single channel currents summate
	- Causes hyperpolarization (AP falling phase)

#### Differences in Na+ and K+ Current
- **Na+ current: rapid, inactivating**
	- Remember that the Na+ channel can deactivate and inactivate
		- Deactivate due to the gate closing
		- Inactivate due to the ball blocking the pore on the extracellular side of the neuron
- **K+ current: slow, noninactivating**
	- Remember that the K+ channel only deactivates
		- And does it slowly at that

#### Na+ and K+ Conductances
- Na+ conductance:
	- Rapid onset (activation)
	- Rapid offset (inactivation)
	- Remember, this stuff turns on and off <u>fast</u>
- K+ conductance
	- Slow onset (activation)
	- Slow offset (deactivation)
	- **Afterhyperpolarization is caused (the undershoot)**
	- Remember, this stuff turns on and off <u>pretty slow</u>
