**Ganglion Cells** are the output cells of [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 4/The Retina\|The Retina]]. They contain axons that form the optic nerve and also project into the brain.

This also forms the optic disk as well, which is our blind spot.

Ganglion cells are the final output neurons of [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 4/Retinal Circuits\|Retinal Circuits]]

Visual information is transmitted to the brain by action potentials.
- When ganglion cells are depolarized, they fire action potentials that convey visual information to the brain (light happens)
- When ganglion cells are hyperpolarized, they do not fire action potentials to the brain (darkness happens)

## Visual Pathways

There are 4 targets that [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 4/Ganglion Cells\|ganglion cells]] are able to project to:
- **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus**
	- This is used for perception
- **Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus**
	- This is used for circadian rhythms (for sleep and wakefulness)
- **Pretectum**
	- This is used for pupil and lens reflexes
		- This causes the size of the pupil to fluctuate
- **Superior colliculus**
	- This is used for head and eye movement
		- Orients the eyes in response to stimuli
- The pathway to the visual cortex is as follows:
	- <font color="#9bbb59">Ganglion cells -> Optic Nerves --> Optic Chiasm --> Optic Tract --> LGN --> Optic Radiation --> Primary Visual Cortex</font>

There are three types of information transmitted by ganglion cells in their outputs:

1. **Form**
2. **Color**
3. **Motion**

There are three types of ganglion cells: **M-type, K-type, and P-type cells**

### M-Type (Parasol Cells)
 - These are large cells
- Project to <u>magnocellular</u> layers of LGN
- Carry *position and motion information*
- Large receptive field
- Faster action potential conduction
- Respond to low-contrast light
- Transient (adaptive) response to center light
- Transmit movement information
- Totally insensitive to color

### K-Type (Midget Cells)
- These are small cells
- Project to <u>karvocellular</u> layers of LGN
- Carry *form and color (red/green) information*
- Smaller receptive field
- Slower action potential conduction
- Sustained and constant response to center light

### P-Type (Bistratisfied Cells)
- These cells are super small, but have massive receptive fields with only centers (no surround)
	- Always ON to the blue cone and OFF to the red and green cones
		- Project to <u>parvocellular</u> regions, between the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the LGN
	- Carry *color (blue/yellow) information*
