**Rod Pathways** are another type of [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 4/Phototransduction\|Phototransduction]] pathway, this time relying only on rods and being an indirect pathway (related to surrounds).

**Rod bipolar cells**
- These are **on-center bipolar cells**
	- Only one type of bipolar cell
		- When light shines on the rod, it is <u>hyperpolarized</u>
			- <u>Less glutamate released</u>
				- This depolarizes the <u>on-center bipolar cells (since they have inhibitory mGluRs),</u> which in turn <u>depolarize the ganglion cells</u>
    - **Amacrine cells**
	- These cells are responsible for action potential generation, and are located right after the rod bipolar cells
	- **Glycine** is the neurotransmitter involved here
		- Amacrine cells <u>release glycine when action potentials go down their axons</u>
			- They're literally just like other neurons
	- **Electrical synapses** with the <u>on-center ganglion cells</u> are **excitatory**
		- These are [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Electrical Synapses#Gap Junctions\|gap junctions]]!
	- **Chemical synapses** with the <u>off-center ganglion cells</u> are **inhibitory**
		- Excitation of on-center cells and inhibition of off-center ganglion cells
			- This means that dark continues for on center and turns off for off-center



>[!info] In Summary:
>
>Indirect pathway as well.
>
>Rod cells are *hyperpolarized* when light hits them, which ends up *depolarizing* rod bipolar cells (mGluR), which end up *depolarizing* ganglion cells.
>
>Amacrine cells interact like horizontal cells here, *exciting* *on-center ganglion cells* and *inhibiting off-center ganglion cells*.
