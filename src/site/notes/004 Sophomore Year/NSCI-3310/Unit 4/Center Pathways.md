**Center Pathways** for [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 4/Phototransduction\|Phototransduction]] are direct pathways to the ganglion cell that use these following cells:

[[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 4/Photoreceptors#Cones\|Cone]] --> **Bipolar cell** --> [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 4/Ganglion Cells\|Ganglion Cells]]

- This is a **Direct/vertical pathway to ganglion cells**
	- Almost direct communication between photoreceptor and the ganglion cell (bipolar cell in the middle)
	- These pathways mediate the center response, either on or off
	- Signals relayed from cones --> bipolar cells --> ganglion cells
    - On/off signals depend on the *bipolar cells and their position in the ganglion cell receptive field*
	- **On-center bipolar cell = Depolarizes**
	- **Off-center bipolar cell = Hyperpolarizes**

### On-Center Bipolar Cells
- Cone and on-center bipolar cell synapse:
	- This is an **inhibitory synapse that uses [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors#Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors\|metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)]]** 
	- Hyperpolarization of the cone occurs when light strikes
		- Decrease in glutamate release occurs from the cone
			- This causes a **depolarization event in the on-center bipolar cell** because the receptors on the on-center bipolar cell are **inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors**
				- Less glutamate release means more excitation of these on-center bipolar cells, because less inhibition is occurring

### Off-Center Bipolar Cells
- Cone and off-center bipolar cell synapse:
	- This is an **excitatory synapse that uses ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs)**
	- Hyperpolarization of the cone occurs when light strikes
		- Decrease in glutamate release occurs from the cone
			- This causes a **hyperpolarization event** in the **off-center bipolar cell** because the receptors on the off-center bipolar cell are **excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptors**
				- *Less glutamate release* means *less excitation* of these off-center bipolar cells

### Bipolar cell --> Ganglion cell synapse
- This is an **excitatory synapse that uses ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs)**
	- Depolarization of the bipolar cell results in more glutamate being released onto the ganglion cell, causing excitation
	- Hyperpolarization of the bipolar cell results in less glutamate being released onto the ganglion cell, causing inhibition

### Ganglion Cells and Synapses
- When depolarized, ganglion cells fire an action potential that goes to the brain, conveying light information
- When hyperpolarized, ganglion cells do not fire an action potential, and darkness continues

>[!info] Essentially:
>
>If the bipolar cell was excited and depolarized, the ganglion cell will be **excited and dark vision will prevail.**
>
>If the bipolar cell was inhibited and hyperpolarized, the ganglion cell will be **inhibited and light vision will prevail.**

>[!note] In Summary:
>
>**On-Center Bipolar Cell**: Depolarized when light strikes, depolarizes ganglion cell, dark vision occurs.
>
>**Off-Center Bipolar Cell**: Hyperpolarized when light strikes, hyperpolarizes ganglion cell, light vision occurs.
