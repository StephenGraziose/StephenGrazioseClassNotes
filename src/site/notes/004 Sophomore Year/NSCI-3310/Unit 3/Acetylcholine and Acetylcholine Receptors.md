**Acetylcholine** is a [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 3/Neurotransmitters\|neurotransmitter]] that is heavily used for excitatory purposes for motor neurons and muscle activity within the nervous system. Acetylcholine is also heavily interlinked with [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/The Neuromuscular Junction\|The Neuromuscular Junction]] and other [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 3/Cholinergic Systems\|Cholinergic Systems]].

### Acetylcholine
- Synthesis in the terminal
	- Precursors: **Acetyl CoA and Choline** (another amino acid)
	- Catalyzed by **choline acetyltransferase**
- Release
	- Postsynaptic receptors
		- Ionotropic
			- **Nicotonic**
				- Na+/K+ channel
		- Metabotropic
			- **Muscarinic**
				- Inhibitory or excitatory
- Termination (breakdown)
	- Acetylcholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine into acetate and choline
- Reuptake
	- Choline transporters will take up acetylcholine
	- Re-synthesis of acetylcholine
	- Transmitter recycling

Receptors for Acetylcholine are also known as AChRs.

There are two AChR subtypes: **Nicotonic Receptors** and **Muscarinic Receptors.**

### Nicotinic Receptors (nAChRs)
- [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Ionotropic Receptors\|Ionotropic]]
	- Antagonist: **Curare**
		- Competitive behavior
- Has 5 protein subunits (pentamer)
	- 2 alpha subunits, 1 beta subunit, 1 delta subunit, and 1 gamma subunit
		- ACh binding site is at the alpha subunits
			- **2 ACh molecules must bind to the subunits** (1 each) to open the channel
- This is a ligand-gated ion channel
	- Ligand = ACh
		- This channel is selective for **both Na+ and K+**
- Overall has a *net INWARD current* that contains both <u>Na+ influx and K+ efflux</u>
	- **Na+ influx dominates K+ efflux**
		- This is because there is a greater concentration differential of Na+ between the inside of the cell and the outside of the cell than K+
- Causes **endplate potentials (EPPs)**
	- These are the *EPSPs of the neuromuscular junction*

### Muscarinic Receptors (mAChRs)
- [[004 Sophomore Year/NSCI-3310/Unit 2/Metabotropic Receptors\|Metabotropic]]
	- GPCR
	- Antagonist: **Atropine**
		- Competitive behavior
- These are located in the CNS and PNS too!
- Opening <u>mAChRs can either be excitatory or inhibitory, but still revolve around Na+ and K+ flow.</u>

>[!info] Summary:
>
>Nicotinic Receptors: Ionotropic, *excitatory* (cause an inward current) and involves Na+ influx and K+ efflux simultaneously. Na+ influx wins out.
>
>Muscarinic Receptors: Metabotropic, triggers a second messenger cascade that is *either inhibitory or excitatory* and involves Na+ and K+ ion flow using second messenger-gated ion channels.
